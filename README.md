# App Flip Sample for Android

[![ci][1]][2]

This sample app demonstrates an App Flip compatible account linking integration
on Android. You can use this app to verify how to respond to an incoming App Flip
intent from Google mobile apps.

The sample app is preconfigured to integrate with the
[App Flip Test Tool for Android](https://github.com/googlesamples/identity-appflip-tester-android),
which you can use to easily get started before you configure account linking
with Google.
